Topological sort doesn't work if there is a cycle in the graph.

C1 -> C2
|      |
V      V
C3    C6 -> C5
  ^         ^
   \        |
    C4 -----

Output: topologically sorted order = [C1, C2, C4, C3, C6, C5]

Implementation: DFS with global stack.
Once you're done processing on a node, you push it onto a stack.
stk = [C5, C6, C2, C3, C1, C4]

Order is stk.reverse()

Another problem: Decipher alien language alphabet from a bunch of encrypted words.
eg - this is the dictionary order of words in alphabetic order:
[dbc, dba, dcb, dca, bdc, bda]

http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting/
DFS order is different from topological sort order in many cases. Topological sort keeps a stack.

DFS algo - Print a node, and then recursively call DFS on adj_nodes.

Topo-sort algo - We dont print vertex immediately,  we first recursively call topo_sort on adj_nodes
Then push node to a stack. Finally print contents of stack.

    Given a list of words in an alien language in dictionary sorted order, return the alphabetical
    order of the letters in the alien language.

    The algorithm is as follows:
    1) Find the number of letters in the alphabet, by going 1 pass over the input array.
        This takes time O(wl). if there are w words and l letters on an avg per word.
        Lets call the result, alpha

    2) Create a digraph with num_vertices = alpha

    3) For every pair of consecutive words (word1, word2) in the input list (there are w - 1 pairs
    in a w-word list),  compare letters of word1 & word2 until you find the 1st mismatching
        character. Add an edge in the digraph from letter in word1 to letter in word2
