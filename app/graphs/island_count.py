"""
Given a map 2D grid of 0 and 1
Where 0 = water, 1 = land, count the number of islands.


|0|1|1|0|0|
|1|1|0|0|1|
|0|0|1|1|0|
|0|1|0|0|0|

Iterate over the 2D matrix, do a DFS on each node.
Go to the next unvisited node and repeat the same. Count how many times you have to do it.

For implicit graph problems, dont create a graph of vertices.
