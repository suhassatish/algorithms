DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH PROPERTIES

DFS runs in O(E + V) time.

PROPOSITION: DFS marks all vertices connected to s in time proportional to
the sum of their degrees.

PROPOSITION: After DFS, can find vertices connected to s in constant time
and can find a path to s (if one exists) in time proportional to its length.

QUESTION: In a Graph G represented using the adjacency-lists representation,
depth-first search marks all vertices connected to s in time proportional to
ANSWER: The sum of the degrees of the vertices in the connected component
containing s

QUESTION: The critical data structures used in depth-first search and
breadth-first search are _____ and ____, respectively.
ANSWER: DFS->Stack BFS->Queue
EXPLANATION: With DFS, it is either an explicit stack(w/ nonrecursive version)
or the function-call stack (w/a recursive version)
