"""
Given a string, find all palindromes among its substrings
eg - input: "abcacbbbca"
output = {"bb", "cac", "bcacb", "bbb", "cbbbc", "acbbbca"}

The brute force solution would be to find
a) all substrings of the string (you can choose a substring by choosing 2 indices i,j such that
substr = str[i:j+1]. Total ways to pick i,j such that 0 <= i,j <= n is nC2 = n!/(2! * (n-2)!) )
= n * (n -1) / 2 = O(n^2)
and for each substring,
b) consider if its a palindrome. (This can be done in 1-pass of 2 pointers i & j
traversing substring from opposite ends until they meet in the middle i.e., in O(n) time)

so its O(n^3). We will implement O(n^2) solution below.

Total number of centers = n - 1 (for odd-sized palindrome) + n - 1 (for even-sized palindrome)
= 2(n - 1)
In above, dont count last character of string as center of longest palindrome as it will be of
size 1, and even the first letter-center is of size 1.

    Note on time complexity: for sparse palindrome strings, it is O(n) since the while loop

    For palindrome-dense strings, it is O(n^2) as potentiall at every position, you can expand
    outwards to the whole string and keep discovering palindromes
