"""
There is a 2-dimensional grid where guards are patrolling a maze.
Where do you place a bomb such that you kill maximum bember of guards (enemy E)?
There can be walls W at certain spots which will block the spread of the bomb along that path.

eg -
|E|E| |
| |W| |
| |H|E|
| |E| |
solution - detonating bomb at H kills 2 guards, but doesnt kill guard behind wall W as wall
saves him.

Separate into 2 independent dimensions like n-queens problem reduced to 1-dimension.
horizontal kills (hkill) and vertical_kills (vkill), then kills[i][j] = hkill[i][j] + vkill[i][j]

Its 3 traversals of n-by-n grid
