"""
An m by n grid a has 0s and 1s. You can move to only squares having 1s but not 0s.
 How many ways can you move from i,j = 0,0 to m-1,n-1?

eg -
1 1
1 1
total_paths = 2

1 0
1 0
total_paths = 0

1 0
0 1
total_paths = 0

1 0
1 1
total_paths = 1

1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
total_paths = 10

Approach: In recursive solution, number of ways to get to i,j =
number of ways to get to i-1,j + number of ways to get to i,j-1.

We cache these in an auxillary 2D matrix and then add them up.

Time and space complexity = O(MN)
