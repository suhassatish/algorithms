DETERMINANT of a matrix is the product of all its eigen values. Absolute value of a determinant can be imagined as
how much the matrix expands or contracts space.

JACOBIAN - When both the inputs and outputs of a function are vectors, the matrix containing all the first-order
partial derivatives is called the Jacobian.
