"""
There are 3 types of processors: A, B and C
Type A: 3 tasks in parallel
Type B: 2 tasks in parallel
Type C: 1/2 task
Question: 100 tasks and 100 processors
A simple program to enumerate all valid assignments of 100 tasks to 100 processors
Valid Assignment: use up all 100 processors to process exactly 100 tasks

Question asked at Apple iTunes analytics team phone screen.
