"""
Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). The iterator interface has 2 methods -
hasNext() and next(). The iterator will be initialized with the root of the BST (can be imbalanced).

hasNext() and next() should run in avg O(1) time and use O(h) memory where h is the height of tree.
