"""
Given a sorted array arr[] and a number x, write a function that counts the occurrences of x in arr[].
  Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3,},   x = 2
  Output: 4 // 2  occurs 4 times in arr[]

    Use binary search to get the last occurrence of x in a[], say j

    Key insight: For left-most occurrence, a[mid] == x and a[mid - 1] != x if mid - 1 is within
    array bounds
    For right-most occurrence, a[mid] == x and a[mid + 1] != x if mid + 1 is within array bounds
