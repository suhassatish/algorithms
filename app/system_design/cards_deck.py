"""
Design a library to model a deck of cards. 4 suites (diamond, heart, spade, club), 13 cards of each suite.
Use case: The library can be called by any 3rd party developer to design simple card games.

Result:
It should be a set of classes with methods and relationships between them.
main() method showing use case by clients
Optionally, state diagrams and flow chart of main use cases if it helps bolster understanding.

future directions:
1) what are the design assumptions and how will design change if those assumptions change?
2) How will you scale the library? - Optimize memory footprint by doing bitwise operations for the 52-deck of cards
    if required.
